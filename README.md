Mega Invaders
=============
Mega Invaders is a revival of the classic top-down shooter "Space Invaders". 38 years ago, humanity invented laser cannons to drive off wave after wave of approaching alien hordes. Now, the aliens are back, and stronger than before.

Goal
----
Fight off the approaching aliens by shooting your missiles at them. Avoid their attack at all costs. Good Luck!

Controls

* J key : fire missiles. Aim at the aliens! You may continuously hold the key.
* Space Bar: confirm. A quicker alternative to pressing buttons to continue the game.
